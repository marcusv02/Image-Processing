# Image-Processing
Assignment from my university's Computer Science degree.

## Overview
This assignment is divided into 5 individual tasks spread across separate Matlab files. 16 images were used containing a swan logo in each at different angles. The tasks were:
1.  Pre-processing - load the image, 'IMG_01.jpg', and convert it to greyscale, reduce the image size to half by bilinear interpolation, produce its histogram
2.  Edge Detection - apply edge detection techniques (Sobel & Canny)
3.  Simple Swan Segmentation - segment the swan using connected component analysis
4.  Swan Recognition - write an automoatic and robust method that is able to accurately detect the swan from all swan logo images provided (without the use of any training, e.g. machine learning based approaches)
5.  Performance Evaluation - Evaluate the method chosen in task 4 by reporting its performance on the entire dataset against the provided ground truth images using Dice Score
